            <h2>Visual Literacy in Design</h2>
            <date>2 - 10 - 2023</date>
            <p> 
                In The New York Times’ <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">“10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a>, Michael Gonchar lays out some strategies for teachers to help their students develope visual literacy. Visual literacy is a crucial skill for almost all areas of design. Even sound designers often have to consider how their sounds interact with the visual elements of a piece of media or UI.
                <br><br>
                The article reminded me that several of my teachers in high school did activities where they would show an image and the class would have to guess what’s going on. I used to think it was just a warm-up activity to get us critically thinking, but now I realize they were trying to build this visual literacy as well. 
                <br><br>
	            A website I found that I thought was particularly innovative with its visuals is The Concrete Club. It’s got several hand drawn animations that happen as the user scrolls through the page. The scroll actually controls these animations, and the user can make the animation go forward or backward depending on which way they scroll. Another interesting facet of the design is the page is infinitely scrolling. The user can scroll through the page and at the end, they continue scrolling down to reveal they’re back where they started. Also, the landing page switches color schemes every time you scroll through which I think is a fun easter egg. Check it out <a href="https://concreteclub.studio/">here</a>.

            <h2>Using Overlays on the Web</h2>
            <date>2 - 10 - 2023</date>
            <p> 
                In <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">“Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes”</a>, Kathryn Whitenton discusses the use and abuse of overlays in online interactions. As someone who has grown up in the internet era, I am all to familiar with how annoying a poorly designed pop-up can be. They can come too soon, have too much information, show up too often, be too big, etc. etc... It seems to me that for every well designed and welcome overlay on the web, there are 5 more that are completely obnoxious.
                <br><br>
                One tip I found interesting was to experiment with the timing of your overlay. Does it come at the beginning of an interaction, in the middle, or at the end? It’s just as important to consider what your user wants to see as when they want to see it. I would love to beam this idea into the heads of every web designer that’s ever set an advertisement to pop-up as soon as you enter a page. It feels like putting an advertisement on a long 2x4 and laying it at the entryway of your store to trip anyone who walks in.
                <br><br>
                I think a use case for overlays that wasn’t discussed in the article could be chunking information. For example: a long list of flower species where clicking on one triggers an overlay with a brief description and some quantitative information about it. The user may not want to see all the info at once, but there is not enough to justify a full new page for each one. There may be other, better ways to solve this design problem, but I think that’s a valid approach.

        <article id = "forms">
            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <date>1 - 30 - 2023</date>
            <p> 
                In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, Salim Ansari outlines 20 rules for usability of online forms. Online forms are horrid, godawful, kafkaesque creations that are fundamentally necessary for everyday online activity. They are the most efficient way to get information from and about your users and put that information to immediate use. As designers, our goal is to make this process as painless as possible. 
                <br><br>
                Some of the tips that I found most interesting from the article were those that delt with constraining the users actions in some capacity. For instance, when the information you require is a number, only allow the user to input numbers. Or perhaps when the input required is a zip code, only allow 5 digits to be entered. This is one of Don Norman’s fundamental principles of design - constraining the users actions so it is easy to do the right thing and very hard to cause failure. 
                <br><br>
                I also found it interesting that form design (or at least that discussed in this article) is geared towards having the user finish the form. I hadn’t considered how much form abandonment might impact the form’s creator but it makes sense - if the user doesn’t finish the form, then all the design and thought leading up to the purchase/signup/scheduling is rendered null and void.
                <br><br>
                I think a great example of form design best practices is creating a google account. They have multiple sections that ask for only a few pieces of information each and great labelling, plus they give you the option to show your password. Check it out <a href= "https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?biz=false&cc=US&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%3Fhl%3Den-US&dsh=S1258665506%3A1675150956364611&flowEntry=SignUp&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&hl=en">here</a>.

            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <date>1 - 30 - 2023</date>
            <p> 
                In <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>, Salim Ansari outlines 20 rules for usability of online forms. Online forms are horrid, godawful, kafkaesque creations that are fundamentally necessary for everyday online activity. They are the most efficient way to get information from and about your users and put that information to immediate use. As designers, our goal is to make this process as painless as possible. 
                <br><br>
                Some of the tips that I found most interesting from the article were those that delt with constraining the users actions in some capacity. For instance, when the information you require is a number, only allow the user to input numbers. Or perhaps when the input required is a zip code, only allow 5 digits to be entered. This is one of Don Norman’s fundamental principles of design - constraining the users actions so it is easy to do the right thing and very hard to cause failure. 
                <br><br>
                I also found it interesting that form design (or at least that discussed in this article) is geared towards having the user finish the form. I hadn’t considered how much form abandonment might impact the form’s creator but it makes sense - if the user doesn’t finish the form, then all the design and thought leading up to the purchase/signup/scheduling is rendered null and void.

                I think a great example of form design best practices is creating a google account. They have multiple sections that ask for only a few pieces of information each and great labelling, plus they give you the option to show your password.

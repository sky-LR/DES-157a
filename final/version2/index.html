            <p>This is my Steinbereger headless bass. It was given to me by my great aunt when I was about 13, which was far to young for me to actually appreciate it. As I’ve gotten older I realized that it was a symbol of my family's support for me pursuing music, which is something I’m eternally grateful for. It went from a weird instrument I never played to my favorite in my collection. I hope to give it to my great nephew someday.</p>

            <p>This is a children’s toy piano I picked up last year at a goodwill for $1.50. I brought it home and immediately launched into the weirdest, funniest jam session I’ve ever been a part of with my roommates. It’s a dinky little machine but it’s now a staple in my collection. Music doesn’t have to be so serious, sometimes the best stuff happens when you just play.</p>

            <p>This is my Epihpone Les Paul guitar. It feels incredible to play. That’s really what I have to say about it. Playing this guitar is like taking a bite of a nice crunchy grape, or popping bubble wrap, or feeling a piece of sea glass between your fingers. I love having this instrument around because I <em>want</em> to play it. It keeps me playing music and that makes my life better. </p>

            <p>This is my Korg Monotron pocket synthesizer which I bought when I was 14. It’s possibly the smallest, cheapest synth you could possibly get, but to me at that age it seemed like a massive purchase. For several months I eyed this synth every time I would go to the music store for my bass lesson until I finally saved enough to buy it. Every time I hold the little thing in my hand and hear its squeaky, pre-pubescent sounds I’m reminded of how far I’ve come.</p>

            <p>This is my one and only acoustic instrument. It’s a Recording King guitar which was gifted to me by my dad and his landlord, Larry. As a music producer, almost all the time I spend making music is on the computer. Recording and editing music takes up massive amounts of time so it’s nice to have portable, non-electronic music I can bring outside, play with friends, or just use to get off my computer now and again. </p>

        <h2>
            After user testing I've come to these conclusions:
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                The first screen doesn’t quite look like it’s scrollable. There’s no explicit indication that the page scrolls, and theres nothing peaking out at the bottom of the screen to let the user know to scroll.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The titles of each instrument aren’t noticeable enough. Something about them being disconnected from the rest of the information in each section makes the user not look at them.
                <br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The overall look of the site is nostalgic, vintage or otherwise old.
                <br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
         The main piece of feedback I got from User Testing is that it’s not 100% clear that the page is supposed to be scrollable. One user said that the title section almost looks like a loading screen and another said it looked like it was supposed to be clickable. With this in mind, I’m going to add some sort of sign that tells the user to scroll if they don’t immediately. A few people got tripped up by the titles of the individual instrument sections. One user didn’t know what I meant when I said the “Monotron” section even though that’s the biggest and heaviest weight text in the section. I had the idea to add some motion to the titles and body just for fun but it might be good to add some to the instrument title to make sure the user notices it. All of my users remarked that the look of the site looks somehow nostalgic or old. My guess is it’s because of the black and white photography. I don’t think I’ll change anything based on this observation since the nostalgic feeling works in my favor as I walk down memory lane with these instruments.

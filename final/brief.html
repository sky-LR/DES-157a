        <p>My final project is going to be cleaning up and expanding my Every Picture project with better visual design and navigation.
        <br><br>
        My main goal for this project is to make the Every Picture project a solid portfolio piece. I want it to be visually appealing, intuitive to navigate, and engaging to interact with. I want it to display my UI/UX and visual design skills, as well as my budding javascript chops. I want to implement more complex navigation code so I have more control over the visuals since scrolling through it right now can create some messy compositions. I’d also like to tweak the visuals to make everything look professional and marketable as a portfolio piece. Finally, I want to add more places for fun “surprise and delight” user interaction.
        <br><br>
        I got some feedback that in the description of the instrument, the white background ends after the body text, leaving the “Play Sound” button on a transparent background. This makes the button feel oddly separate from the rest of the content and just looks inconsistent so I’d like to put the button on the same white background. I think there’s also some inconsistency in the header padding so I’ll clean that up. I also think there might be room to move the header and content further into the center of the screen so the composition feels more whole and less work to navigate visually.
        <br><br>
        I’d like to add a couple more places for user interaction. Specifically, I want to add some animation and visual feedback when a sound is played. I’ll have to experiment with it but some animation of the instrument or the halftone effect behind it could be interesting. I might also animate the button to look like it’s radiating sound while the sound is playing and have a different interaction for the halftone image. Specifically, Professor Drew said that having the effect shake and jitter when you mouse over it could be interesting. I also want to implement a new navigation system where the user can click on the images of the instruments to navigate to them, so I’d like to have the instrument the user is hovering over turn yellow.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I want the experience of moving through the site to be much different. Currently the navigation on scroll looks a little messy and could be more engaging. I have a few ideas to experiment with in that regard. One idea I had is to position all the sections on top of each other and only make visible the one the user is currently on. I could also keep the scroll and snap the header/content to the top of the screen when the user gets within a certain range of it. There could also be some animation of the typography where it fades in or comes in from off-screen when you get to a section. I’ll try some of these out and see what works best visually. I also have the idea to animated the instruments so that they gently spin when you load the page and  snap to the original position when the user mouses over them.
